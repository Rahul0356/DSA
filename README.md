🚀 My DSA Journey

Hi 👋 I’m Rahul Kumar, a passionate MERN Stack Developer always exploring ways to improve as a problem solver.
Today marks the beginning of my 90 Days DSA Challenge, where I’ll dedicate every day to learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript (ES6).

After exploring multiple resources and roadmaps, I chose to follow Namaste DSA by Akshay Saini — a structured and beginner-friendly way to understand DSA from the ground up.

This repository will serve as a transparent record of my journey — including code, notes, and daily progress — to help others learning DSA in JavaScript.
