ðŸš€ Day 1 of My 90 Days DSA Challenge

Today marks the beginning of my 90 Days DSA Challenge! I spent the day researching effective ways to learn Data Structures and Algorithms â€” exploring various roadmaps, YouTube channels, and community recommendations. After careful consideration, I decided to follow Namaste DSA by Akshay Saini, as it provides clear explanations and uses JavaScript (ES6), which aligns perfectly with my learning goals.

To stay consistent and accountable, Iâ€™ve created a GitHub repository to document my daily progress, share notes, and upload code â€” hoping it can also help others who are on the same learning path.
